# The following fucntion is to take a dns query field and break it down to its sld, tld, subdomain. For example
# www.google.com will be broken down into tld=com sld=google tld=www subdomain=google.com
# !!!!You must install the following plugin for this to work in logstash (third party plugin from github)
# bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-plugin-tld
tld {
	# My example is grabbing the query field in a BRO DNS LOG (IE: www.google.com) and creating a new fields (second and third level domain)
	source => "query"
	remove_field => "[tld][subdomain]"
}

#to get the string length of any field in your data set. In my case BRO DNS log field of query
ruby {
	# My example is grabbing the query field in a BRO DNS LOG (IE: www.google.com)
	# The .set is creating a new field & the .get is selecting a field that you want to get the string length and feed that into the .set new field
	code => 'event.set['query_length'], event.get['query'].length'
}

#Enrichment - string entropy using Logstash
ruby {
	# This code runs entropy math against a field like a BRO DNS LOG query
	# This will create a new field called "entropy" with the value for example 3.56467546 
	# It is recommended to set this value as a scaled_float mapping in elasticsearch. Read the Elasticsearch Docs on Scaled_floats
	# and scaling factors
	code => '
	s = event.get['query']
	event.set['entropy'], s.each_char.group_by(&:to_s).values.map{|x|x.length/s.length.to_f}.reduce(0){|e,x|e-x*Math.log2(x)}
	'
}

#This below is if you want to use GEOIP fucntion and only use the Country Name and Location field instead of all the fields that GEOIP Creates

geoip {
	source => "dst_ip"
	fields => ["country_name", "location"]
}
